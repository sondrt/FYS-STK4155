It seems that the SIRS model is a great system dynamics model for representing real diseases, in general a great foundation to build on for predicting disease, in this case, and how they establish themselvs within the population. We have also seen that it is very versatile, with a few improvements tested out, and combined in this report. It was shown that a Monte Carlo simulation were a great way of approaching the differential equations in a more realistic manner, if given a large enough dataset.
